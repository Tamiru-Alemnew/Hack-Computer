```
Memory Types:
1. Main memory -- Eg. RAM
(RAM is used in storing data and instructions)
2. Secondary memory-- Eg. Disks
3. Volatile/Non-Volatile
```
```
Perspectives -- Physical and Logical
```
```
In this course,
There will be focus on main memory and logical perspectives.
```
```
The basic memory element --> Register
We already learned about 1-bit register in previous chapter dealing with Flip Flops.
```
Here.. we will see multi-bit register. <br>

# Nand2Tetris Hack Computer Hardware Project

This repository contains my implementation of the Hack computer hardware as part of the Nand2Tetris course. The project covers the construction of a complete computer system from the ground up, starting from basic logic gates to the development of a full-fledged computer capable of running simple programs.

## Overview

The Nand2Tetris course (officially known as "The Elements of Computing Systems") guides learners through the process of building a modern computer system from first principles. This repository includes my solutions and implementations for the various modules and components of the Hack computer.

## Contents

- **Hardware Description Language (HDL) files:** Implementation of logic gates, the ALU, and the CPU using HDL.
- **Test Scripts:** Scripts to test the functionality of each component and the overall system.
- **Projects:** Organized by chapters, reflecting the progressive development of the computer.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations and notes on the design and implementation choices made during the project.

## Features

### Basic Logic Gates
- NAND
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- XOR
- MUX
- DMUX

### Combinational Chips
- Half Adder
- Full Adder
- ALU

### Sequential Chips

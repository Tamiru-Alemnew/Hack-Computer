Alan Turing built a cool universal Turing machine, where it was seen as something that could perform all possible operations.<br>
Whereas, von Neumann combined the universal turing machine on running programs by proposing a cool architecture known as "von Neumann's architecture". <br>
Due to these two great human geniuses, today's modern software/hardware are alive & surviving. <br>
